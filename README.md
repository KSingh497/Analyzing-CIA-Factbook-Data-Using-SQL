# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL

In this project we will use SQL to analyze some of the data in the CIA World Factbook. The purpose is to show how data stored in a database can be analyzed with SQL.

The CIA World Factbook provides various data points about 267 world entities. Below are some examples of these data points:

Demographics
Enonomy
Transportation
Energy
Communications
Government
Military
Geography
History

The database file in this project contains a selection of these data points. We will use SQL to answer some basic questions about the data. Most of the time the answers will be observed in cell output immediately following code cells and will not be spelled out into separate sentences to avoid wordiness and duplication.

Tasks we will complete in this excercise:

Connect jupyter notebook to the CIA factbook database
Explore database
Explore indivdual tables in the database
Generate statistics from the "facts" table
